  /* LEVEL UP! (optional) 
      1. Function explanations: 
       - validateRoomNumber() function works by taking in two parameters, functionName
         and roomNumber, to verify that the room number is either 1 or 2. The function
         also makes sure that 1 or 2 is not in a string format, "1" or "2". It also
         makes sure that there must be a parameter for roomNumber. The funtion will
         either return true or false.
  
      - getRoomWidth() function works by taking in one parameter, roomNumber. The
        function will then call the validateRoomNumber() function to verify that 
        the roomNumber is valid. If false, then it returns 0. If true, it will 
        then return the room width. 
  
  
      2. Custom styles added: 
       - I add the classes .description and .calculation to make the text 
         more responsive to various screen sizes. 
      - I noticed that the text had a good size when on smaller screens compared
        to larger screens. This also makes the website more accessible for users.
